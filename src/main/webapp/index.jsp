		<h1><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h1>
		<h3> LARGEST JAVA LEARNING PLATFORM 

GANA TECHNOLOGY is the world's ace Java development training organization with an aim to bridge the gap between the demands of the industry and the curriculum of educational institutions.

With centers across the Globe, the institute is a platform where young minds are given the opportunity to build successful careers.

”GANA TECHNOLOGY  is a place where businesses find talent and dreams take flight.
This institute thrives on the insecurities of the students. The counsellors treat the students like dirt. The only interaction they ever want with a student is about the fees!

Classes never start on time. Because, apparently, students' time is of no value. Class timings are not fixed even after 2 weeks of beginning of the program. If someone goes to the counsellors to discuss it, they shoot your arguments down by saying something like "we're giving you so many hours of training every day. why do you want the class timings to be fixed?""</h3>
